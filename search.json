Maybe you‚Äôre dehydrated.\nDid you get enough sleep last night? Lack of sleep can cause headaches.\nHave you been staring at a screen for too long? Take a break from your phone and computer.\nDid you eat properly today? Skipping meals can lead to headaches.\nHave you been stressed lately? Sometimes tension can trigger headaches.\nLet me get you a glass of water and a painkiller. It might help.\nHave you tried relaxing and taking deep breaths? Sometimes that can relieve headache symptoms.\nMaybe you should lie down and rest for a while. Your body needs some down time.\nIf the headache persists, we can schedule a doctor‚Äôs appointment, just to be safe.\nRemember to take care of yourself and listen to your body.
