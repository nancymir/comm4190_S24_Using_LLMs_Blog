    ">The album cover for \"Llamada Perdida\" is a beautifully intricate and symbolic representation of Prince Royce's journey as an artist. The main image is a vintage, rusted payphone located in the middle of a vibrant, bustling cityscape at dusk, evoking the theme of lost calls and missed connections. The payphone is adorned with colorful graffiti, each marking a symbol of a song on the album - a champagne glass for \"Champaña\", an intricately sketched heart for \"Matar El Sentimiento\", a crumpled paper for \"Un Papel\", a wave for \"La Corriente\", and so on. Prince Royce himself is depicted in the foreground, leaning against the payphone, dressed in a sleek black suit, his gaze focused on a crumpled piece of paper in his hand – perhaps a lost number, or the lyrics to his next song. His expression is one of contemplation and determination, reflecting the maturity of his lyrics and his self-confidence as an artist. His silhouette against the setting sun creates a striking contrast, symbolizing the end of one chapter and the beginning of another. The album title, \"Llamada Perdida\", is written in bold, white letters at the top of the cover, standing out against the deep, twilight blue of the cityscape. The font is modern and edgy, adding to the contemporary feel of the cover. In contrast, Prince Royce's name is displayed in a classic, elegant script at the bottom, a nod to his enduring presence in the Latin music scene. The overall aesthetic is a perfect blend of the old and the new, just like the music on the album itself.\n",
